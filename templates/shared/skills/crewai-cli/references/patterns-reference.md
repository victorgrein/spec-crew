# CrewAI Cli - Patterns and Archetypes

This document captures reusable patterns, archetypes, and workflow guidance for `crewai-cli`.

## Common Archetypes and Patterns

### Common Workflows

- Refer to SKILL.md for details.

## Integration Patterns

- Pair with `crewai-agents` for role/goal/backstory contracts.
- Pair with `crewai-tasks` for deterministic output and dependencies.
- Pair with `crewai-debugging` and `crewai-optimization` for reliability/performance loops.

## Workflow Notes

- Define constraints first, then implementation details.
- Use measurable checkpoints at each major step.
- Preserve progressive disclosure: keep SKILL.md concise and place depth here.
